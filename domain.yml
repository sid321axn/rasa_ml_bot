  - text: "Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that\
      \ provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience\
      \ without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development\
      \ of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.\n\
      The process of learning begins with observations or data, such as examples,\
      \ direct experience, or instruction, in order to look for patterns in data and\
      \ make better decisions in the future based on the examples that we provide.\
      \ \n**The primary aim is to allow the computers learn automatically** without\
      \ human intervention or assistance and adjust actions accordingly.\n"

    text: Variance, in the context of Machine Learning, is a type of error that occurs
      due to a model's sensitivity to small fluctuations in the training set. High

      Neural networks help us cluster and classify. You can think of them as a clustering
      and classification layer on top of the data you store and manage. They help
      to group unlabeled data according to similarities among the example inputs,

  utter_faq/knn:
  - text: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is one of the simplest algorithms used in Machine
      Learning for regression and classification problem. KNN algorithms use data
      and classify new data points based on similarity measures (e.g. distance function)
      \n Classification is done by a majority vote to its neighbors. The data is assigned
      to the class which has the nearest neighbors. As you increase the number of

      etc. Model parameters differ for each experiment and depend on the type of data
      and task at hand.\n Model hyperparameters, on the other hand, are common for
      similar models and cannot be learnt during training but are set beforehand.

  utter_faq/pca:
  - text: __Principal Component Analysis, or PCA,__ is a dimensionality-reduction
      method that is often used to reduce the dimensionality of large data sets, by
      transforming a large set of variables into a smaller one that still contains
      most of the information in the large set.\n Reducing the number of variables
      of a data set naturally comes at the expense of accuracy, but the trick in dimensionality
      reduction is to trade a little accuracy for simplicity. Because smaller data
      sets are easier to explore and visualize and make analyzing data much easier
      and faster for machine learning algorithms without extraneous variables to process.
      \n So to sum up, the idea of PCA is simple — reduce the number of variables
      of a data set, while preserving as much information as possible.
  utter_faq/pca_rot:
  - text: Rotation (orthogonal) is necessary to account the maximum variance of the

      in.\n Having irrelevant features in your data can decrease the accuracy of the
      models and make your model learn based on irrelevant features. \n Following
      are the key benefits of feature selection.\n1. __Reduces Overfitting__ Less
      redundant data means less opportunity to make decisions based on noise.\n 2.

      - It can handle thousands of input variables without variable deletion. \n -
      It gives estimates of what variables are important in the classification. \n
      - It generates an internal unbiased estimate of the generalization error as
      the forest building progresses.\n - It has an effective method for estimating
      missing data and maintains accuracy when a large proportion of the data are
      missing.\n - It has methods for balancing error in class population unbalanced
      data sets.\n - Generated forests can be saved for future use on other data.
      \n - Prototypes are computed that give information about the relation between
      the variables and the classification.\n - It computes proximities between pairs
      of cases that can be used in clustering, locating outliers, or (by scaling)
      give interesting views of the data.\n - The capabilities of the above can be

      which outputs continuous number values, logistic regression transforms its output
      using the logistic **sigmoid function** to return a probability value which
      can then be mapped to two or more discrete classes.\n

      \n A Generative Model ‌learns the __joint probability distribution p(x,y)__.
      It predicts the conditional probability with the help of __Bayes Theorem__.
      A Discriminative model ‌learns the __conditional probability distribution p(y|x)__.
      \n Both of these models were generally used in __supervised learning problems__.

    text: Support Vector Machine or SVM is one of the most popular Supervised Learning
      algorithms, which is used for Classification as well as Regression problems.
      However, primarily, it is used for Classification problems in Machine Learning.
      \n The goal of the SVM algorithm is to create the best line or decision boundary
      that can segregate n-dimensional space into classes so that we can easily put
      the new data point in the correct category in the future. This best decision
      boundary is called a **hyperplane**.\n SVM chooses the extreme points/vectors
      that help in creating the hyperplane. These extreme cases are called as **support
      vectors**, and hence algorithm is termed as **Support Vector Machine**. \n Consider
      the above image in which there are two different categories that are classified
      using a decision boundary or hyperplane.
  utter_faq/classification:
  - text: In machine learning, classification refers to a predictive modeling problem
      where a class label is predicted for a given example of input data.\n Examples
      of classification problems include- Given an example, classify if it is spam
      or not. Given a handwritten character, classify it as one of the known characters.
  utter_faq/cross_val:
  - text: __Cross-validation__ is a resampling procedure used to evaluate machine
      learning models on a limited data sample. The procedure has a single parameter
      called k that refers to the number of groups that a given data sample is to
      be split into. As such, the procedure is often called __k-fold cross-validation__.
  utter_faq/adaboost:
  - text: AdaBoost, short for __Adaptive Boosting__, is the first practical boosting
      algorithm proposed by Freund and Schapire in 1996. It focuses on classification
      problems and aims to convert a set of weak classifiers into a strong one.\n
      AdaBoost works by putting more weight on difficult to classify instances and
      less on those already handled well.\n AdaBoost algorithms can be used for both
      classification and regression problem.\n
  utter_faq/gradient_descent:
  - text: Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to find the values of
      parameters (coefficients) of a function (f) that minimizes a cost function (cost).
      \n Gradient descent is best used when the parameters cannot be calculated analytically
      (e.g. using linear algebra) and must be searched for by an optimization algorithm.
      \n A gradient simply measures the change in all weights with regard to the change
      in error. You can also think of a gradient as the slope of a function. The higher
      the gradient, the steeper the slope and the faster a model can learn. But if
      the slope is zero, the model stops learning.\n In mathematical terms, a gradient
      is a partial derivative with respect to its inputs.
  utter_faq/types_gradient_desc:
  - text: There are three popular types of gradient descent that mainly differ in
      the amount of data they use-\n 1. Batch gradient descent\n 2. Stochastic gradient
      descent\n 3. Mini-batch gradient descent\n
  utter_faq/ml_pipe:
  - text: A machine learning pipeline is used to help automate machine learning workflows.
      They operate by enabling a sequence of data to be transformed and correlated
      together in a model that can be tested and evaluated to achieve an outcome,
      whether positive or negative.

  - text: On an Average, an ML Engineer can expect a salary of __₹719,646 (IND)__
      or __$111,490 (US)__.
  utter_faq/gradient_boost:
  - text: Gradient boosting is a type of machine learning boosting. It relies on the
      intuition that the best possible next model, when combined with previous models,
      minimizes the overall prediction error. \n The key idea is to set the target
      outcomes for this next model in order to minimize the error.
  utter_faq/automl:
  - text: automated Machine Learning (AutoML) is tied in with producing Machine Learning
      solutions for the data scientist without doing unlimited inquiries on data preparation,
      model selection, model hyperparameters, and model compression parameters.\n
      On top of that AutoML frameworks help the data scientist in \n Data visualization
      \n Model intelligibility \n Model deployment \n AutoML is viewed as about algorithm
      selection, hyperparameter tuning of models, iterative modeling, and model evaluation.
      It is about making Machine Learning tasks easier to use less code and avoid
      hyper tuning manually.
  utter_faq/regression:
  - text: Regression analysis consists of a set of machine learning methods that allow
      us to predict a continuous outcome variable (y) based on the value of one or
      multiple predictor variables (x).\n Briefly, the goal of regression model is
      to build a mathematical equation that defines y as a function of the x variables.
      Next, this equation can be used to predict the outcome (y) on the basis of new
      values of the predictor variables (x).\n The linear regression equation can
      be written as y = b0 + b*x + e, where\n b0 is the intercept,\n b is the regression
      weight or coefficient associated with the predictor variable x. \n e is the
      residual error
